<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello! I'm a recent graduate of the University of California, San Diego, with a degree in Mathematics - Computer Science while double minoring in urban planning and dance. 
    At UCSD, I served as an intern at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and a tutor for the Computer Science Department. 
    Through my courses, internship, and tutoring, I developed my proficiency in Java, Python and HTML, with the capability to pick up new languages quickly.
</p>
<p>
    With my urban planning minor focusing on GIS, transportation planning, and public transportation, I have gained an appreciation for data science, its role in urban planning to succinctly convey ideas, and the influence of data on our decision-making.
</p>
<p>
    With my proficiency in programming and growing knowledge of the tools and techniques of urban planning, 
    I want to propel progress with equitable solutions, ensuring a future for the many, and not the few.
