<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p class="message">
    Welcome to my website! I'm not sure how you got here since I have yet to share this link publicly. 
    Currently, it is still a work in progress, but hopefully it will be ready by the end of the month. 
    In the meantime, <br /> <code>It's a Secret to Everybody</code> 
</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello! I'm an undergraduate Mathematics - Computer Science (Math-CS) student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), 
    an intern at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, & a tutor for the Computer Science Department at UCSD. 
    Through my courses, internship, & tutoring, I developed my proficiency in Java, Python & HTML, with the capability to pick up new languages quickly.
</p>
<p>
    I am also pursuing an Urban Planning minor at UCSD, with a focus on GIS, transportation planning, & public transportation. 
    With GIS, I have gained an appreciation for data science, its role in urban planning to succinctly convey ideas, & the influence of data on our decision making.
</p>
<p>
    With my proficiency in programming & growing knowledge of the tools & techniques of urban planning, 
    I want to propel progress with equitable solutions, ensuring a future for the many, & not the few.
