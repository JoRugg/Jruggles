<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    Hello! I'm an undergraduate Mathematics - Computer Science (Math-CS) student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), 
    an intern at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), and a tutor for the Computer Science Department at UCSD. 
    Through my courses, internship, and tutoring, I developed my proficiency in Java, Python and HTML, with the capability to pick up new languages quickly.
</p>
<p>
    I am also pursuing an Urban Planning minor at UCSD, with a focus on GIS, transportation planning, and public transportation. 
    With GIS, I have gained an appreciation for data science, its role in urban planning to succinctly convey ideas, and the influence of data on our decision making.
</p>
<p>
    With my proficiency in programming and growing knowledge of the tools and techniques of urban planning, 
    I want to propel progress with equitable solutions, ensuring a future for the many, and not the few.
