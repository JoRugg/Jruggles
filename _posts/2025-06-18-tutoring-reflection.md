<!--Summary-->
With graduation now behind me and the start of a new chapter in my career journey, I figured now is the time to look back on the past 3 years I spent as a Computer Science tutor for UCSD. This is a personal reflection that should also serve as valuable insight into what I did in a typical day as a tutor, highlight the skills I gained throughout the years, and reveal where I still have room to grow.

<!--Working With different professors-->
Through all three years, I tutored a variety of programming courses under different professors, primarily taught using Java and C.  

<!--Description of Duties-->
As a tutor, my primary duties across all classes involved holding office hours, grading assignments, and answering questions on Piazza, the class forum.

<!--Communicating and collaborating with other tutors across the department-->


<!--Challenges during hours-->


<!--Student, professor, and personal feedback-->


<!--Signoff-->
I hope this post provided valuable insight into my tutoring experience.
